//! The Projector implementation for the Holodekk.
//!
//! The projector is the glue between the Holodekk platform and the subroutines it runs.
//! Subroutines make requests of the Projector, and the Projector keeps them up to date with the
//! current state of the system.
// use holodekk_projector::server::{ServerHandle, ServerManager};
// use holodekk_projector::AdminService;
// use holodekk_projector::MyGreeter;
